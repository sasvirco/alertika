# Alertika

Alertika  is a tool for alerting based on patterns of interest from data collected by Cloudwatch logs. 

# Overview

Alertika  works by executing LogInsights queries against cloudwatch log groups and sending an SNS notification if a match is found.
It keeps an in-memory database where it tracks rules that are in Alert mode and sends a recovery notification when the rule no longer matches.

# Running alertika
## Install 
Simply run make in the root folder:
```
make
```
The resulting binary will be stored in bin/alertika
Current version does not support multiple aws accounts, so you need to run multiple versions of it for every account you want to monitor.
Cwlogs-alert will inherit your aws configuration, so before your run it you need to specify which aws profile it will use:

```
export AWS_PROFILE=my-profile
```

The following invocation can be used to run alertika after compiling it:

```
$bin/alertika -config examples/config.toml
```

# Configuration
Configuration file contains 2 major sections general, and rules. The format is toml.
## General
```
run_interval = "60s" 

# golang text/template
sns_message_template = """
Rule {{.Rule.Name }} changed status to {{.State}}
At least {{ .Rule.NumEvents }} match(es) occured in the last {{ .Rule.Timeframe }}

Query: 
{{ .Rule.Query }}

Result: 
{{  .Result }}
"""
```
* run_interval - a string representing how long to wait before the query cycles (defaults to 60s ). 
* template - a golang text/template that is used to render the message that will be send.

## Rules
```
[rules]
#  A timeframe string is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms" or "2h45m". 
#  Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

```
* name - Name of the rule
* log_group - the cloudwatchlogs log group that contains the log streams we would like to search in
* num_events - the minimum number of events our query should produce to trigger the alert
* timeframe - how long back in time we want to search (Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h")
* query - cloudwatchlog insights query to execute (use the CloudWatch Logs Insights console to validate the query)
* sns_topic - an aws sns topic to send the notification
